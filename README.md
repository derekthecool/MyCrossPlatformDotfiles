# Dereks Cross-Platform Configuration Files

I primarily live in the terminal for everything. Coding, journaling, email, web
browsing... the list goes on.
**To be comfortable on your computer you need to cherish your dot file
configuration üíñ!**

## Quick Installation Guide

Prerequisites before installing:

- `Óôù` git
- `ÓöÉ` Powershell 7 or higher

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekthecool/MyCrossPlatformDotfiles/master/MyCrossPlatformScripts/Invoke-DotGit.ps1' -OutFile ~/dot.ps1
~/dot.ps1
rm ~/dot.ps1
```

## Cross Platform Support

This configuration contains everything for my windows and Linux dot files.
While many of the programs are specific to either windows or Linux the
management and configuration setup of this repo is cross platform.

I'm using pwsh - the cross platform powershell for all of the repo management
scripts. Fresh installs, bare repo commit helpers, etc.

### Why Powershell?

Powershell is often seen as a Windows only tool.

My experience with it started with just trying to use the terminal for
everything. Using a Windows computer for work I've had to choose between legacy
CMD, powershell. There is WSL, and that can be great for getting a virtual Linux
setup it is still a bit sandboxed. So powershell was the clear choice.

Powershell is [FOSS](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme)
using the MIT license.

While I adore bash, zsh, fish, and other Linux only shells powershell is a clear
choice for a cross platform setup. Starting with powershell version 6 it is
cross platform. At the time of creating this configuration I'm using powershell
version 7.4.2.

Also Powershell is amazing because it uses an object pipeline and not just a
text pipeline. This provides so much power and makes basic tasks easier.

### Powershell Module [Dots](./Scripts/Dots/Dots.psd1]

This repo comes with a powershell module included. This module is loaded with
functions to help with managing this repo as a git bare repo.
Many more functions are included as well.

For a fresh install run the script to get dependency modules installed

```powershell
./Scripts/Bootstrap-RequiredModules.ps1
```

Now the module can be loaded in two different ways.

1. Explicit load with `Import-Module -Force Dots`. After running this every
   function from the module will be availble for use.
2. Calling any of the **lazy loaded** functions from [Dots.psd1](./Scripts/Dots/Dots.psd1)
   As of July 2024, this list is pretty short containing only these functions: - `dot`: function for running any git commands but for the bare repo
   setup that I use for this repository. - `dots`: similar to dot but runs on all of my most important other
   mission critical repositories including:

   - `dot`
   - `dots`
   - `Initialize-Dotfiles`
   - `Clone-GitRepository`
   - `Add-MasonToolsToPath`

### Powershell Profile

You can find where your profile is from the built in variable `$PROFILE`.
It is important to not load more than necessary in your powershell profile.

Functions that are not essential to be in the profile, should be moved into the
powershell module `./Scripts/Dots/`
