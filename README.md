# Dereks Cross-Platform Configuration Files

I primarily live in the terminal for everything. Coding, journaling, email, web browsing... the list goes on.
**To be comfortable on your computer you need to cherish your dot file configuration ðŸ’–!**

## Cross Platform Support

This configuration contains everything for my windows and Linux dot files.
While many of the programs are specific to either windows or Linux the
management and configuration setup of this repo is cross platform.

I'm using pwsh - the cross platform powershell for all of the repo management
scripts. Fresh installs, bare repo commit helpers, etc.

## Quick Installation Guide

TODO: this is not working last time I tried it... ðŸ˜¦
